# CS 105 - In Class Exercises - Starters and Completed Solutions

This repository contains starters projects and completed solutions for in-class exercises in CS105 - Theory and Practice I at Santa Barbara City College.  

To start an in-class exercise, open a specific starter project folder rather than the root or the 1 - Starters folder.  Otherwise, you may have trouble getting projects to run.
